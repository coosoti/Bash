Certainly! Here are some bash code examples that demonstrate the usage of quotes for different scenarios:

1. Using single quotes to signify a literal string:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

name='John Doe'
echo 'Hello, '$name'!'    # Output: Hello, John Doe!
```
In this example, the single quotes ensure that the string literal `Hello, ` and `!` are not interpreted as variables. The variable `$name` is concatenated with the surrounding text.

2. Using double quotes to format commands and variables inside a value:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

count=3
echo "There are $count apples."    # Output: There are 3 apples.
echo "The current date is $(date)."    # Output: The current date is <current date>.
```
In this example, the double quotes allow the expansion of variables (`$count`) and the execution of commands (`$(date)`). The values inside the double quotes are evaluated and replaced accordingly.

3. Enclosing a value with spaces in quotes:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

value="This is a value with spaces"
echo "$value"    # Output: This is a value with spaces
```
In this example, the value with spaces is enclosed in double quotes. The quotes preserve the spaces and treat the entire value as a single entity.

It's important to note that using quotes appropriately helps ensure proper interpretation of values, variables, and commands in bash scripting.
